        <h2>Overlays Design Pattern Reaserch</h2>
        <p><time datetime="01-30-2025">January 30, 2025</time></p>
        <p><a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</a> gave me a lot of insight on how to create intuitive model windows on my website. I didn't really hear the term be referred to as modal windows since I usually hear them be called as pop-up windows because they literally pop up on your screen when you select something.</p>

        <p>According to the article, modal windows are good at making certain tasks more of a priority due to the window taking up the entire screen while usually dimming the rest of the window estate. One important tip to remember is to always have an accessible exit method, whether it be from a button that says "close" or the ability to use the Escape key to exit, these are the most universal designs that users look for when they want to exit out of a window. </p>

        <p>Another important part of modal windows is that the window should only pop up if the user prompts it to. If not, the window is unwanted to the user and will be treated as such. Another example I can think of this would be ad pop-ups, where model windows would suddenly pop up when you are in the middle of doing something, which is extremely annoying because it breaks your workflow. Overall, these tips are incredibly useful to remember and refer back to!</p>

        <h2>Best practices for Form Design</h2>
        <p><time datetime="01-20-2025">January 20, 2025</time></p>
        <p><a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best practices for form design</a> has a bunch of tips for learning how to create user friendly forms for your website. The website is nicely formatted with a list to number each tip, vertical left lines to signify quotes, and pictures to break up the text. I like how some tips included a visual aid of Do's and Don'ts as well as examples of what the best practice would look like. Unfortunately, not all tips have a visual but it's resolved by included examples in text. But I would have liked if all of the tips had pictures. </p>

        <p>One example of a website form that follows some of these best practices is when <a href="https://accounts.google.com/signin">creating a google email</a>. The link first takes you to a page where you enter your first and last name.</p> 

        <p><img src="images/googleSignUpBD.png" alt="Screenshot of Google Sign Up"></p>

        <p>After clicking Next, there's a new page that asks for your month, day, and year of birth as well as gender. I like how the Month, Day, and Year forms are smaller than the Gender form, because users only need to put a max of 2 digits or a single word which doesn't need that much space.</p>

        <p>Overall, this article is really helpful and useful to go back and reference when I am designing my own forms. </p>
