        <h2>Visual Thinking Analysis</h2>
        <p><time datetime="02-12-2025">February 12, 2025</time></p>
        <p>I exchanged ideas with Emma. I really like her idea of creating an I Spy layout by collaging images that she took as she grew up! I can just imagine the amount of easter eggs or little nods to certain events that she experienced, true to the name of the game. She showed me various snap shots of her life, such as her birthday cake, her playing soccer when she was little, as well as her cat dog.</p>

        <p>I chose to post this particular photo because it was a day of happiness for her, and she chose to celebrate the day with her dog by putting the Happy Birthday hat on top of their head and taking a picture. I didn't discuss this with her but later one, I also spotted tons of plants in the background, which I can only assume that they have a green thumb or that other guests and friends have brought flowers to celebrate the day. Emma is also kind of wearing white clothes that match her dog, whether that was intentional or not. </p>

        <p>For my ideas, I wanted to incorporate Transformers into my project. One of my first ideas was to combine my collection of Transformers and Nail Polish together where users can click on a Transformer and a color combo would pop up using that specific Transformer's color scheme. I'm still not too sure about my idea though. I got inspired by Emma's I Spy idea and created another idea where I could create a layout of what I experienced as a Transformers colletor, such as buying the figures from a location, taking the toy and its accessories out of the box, posing them, placing them on my desk, etc. Basically like a documentation? </p>



        <h2>Visual Thinking Strategies Research</h2>
        <p><time datetime="02-10-2025">February 10, 2025</time></p>
        <p>Michael Gonchar's <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/" target="_blank">10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills</a>gave me a lot to think about when it came to trying to come up with ideas for my Every Picture Project. It reminds me of the famous quote, "A picture is worth a thousand words.", in the sense that there's a lot happening within a single picture that can't be quickly understood in a short timeframe. Which is why stopping for more than a moment and really analyzing what's going on in the picture is important, so that we might find details that we might not have seen otherwise.</p>

        <p>While browsing through <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/ " target="_blank">awwwards.com</a>, my attention was first caught on <a href="https://www.prettypatty.ch/" target="_blank">Pretty Patty</a> not only because I was hungry but also because I  thought its color scheme of yellow with blue is an interesting choice for what I assumed to be a food website. As I was scrolling through the website, I noticed the great amounts of images used throughout the website. With my limited html knowledge on image interaction, the interactions were very simple. For example, the hero image first loaded as a cropped circle and then it expanded as I scrolled down in order to cover the entire screen with the image. There was like a second of gray screen before everything loaded up. The next image interaction consisted of smaller shaped images in a horizontal scroll that moved as I scrolled down. Other assets like the headers and certain sections would have an animation where it looked like it faded in or zipped into place. There certain sections where phrases would continuously move as a secondary piece to the section.</p>

        <p>Overall, they used lots of images but with simple animations!</p>

        <h2>Overlays Design Pattern Reaserch</h2>
        <p><time datetime="01-30-2025">January 30, 2025</time></p>
        <p><a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c" target="_blank">Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</a> gave me a lot of insight on how to create intuitive model windows on my website. I didn't really hear the term be referred to as modal windows since I usually hear them be called as pop-up windows because they literally pop up on your screen when you select something.</p>

        <p>According to the article, modal windows are good at making certain tasks more of a priority due to the window taking up the entire screen while usually dimming the rest of the window estate. One important tip to remember is to always have an accessible exit method, whether it be from a button that says "close" or the ability to use the Escape key to exit, these are the most universal designs that users look for when they want to exit out of a window. </p>

        <p>Another important part of modal windows is that the window should only pop up if the user prompts it to. If not, the window is unwanted to the user and will be treated as such. Another example I can think of this would be ad pop-ups, where model windows would suddenly pop up when you are in the middle of doing something, which is extremely annoying because it breaks your workflow. Overall, these tips are incredibly useful to remember and refer back to!</p>

        <h2>Best practices for Form Design</h2>
        <p><time datetime="01-20-2025">January 20, 2025</time></p>
        <p><a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f" target="_blank">Best practices for form design</a> has a bunch of tips for learning how to create user friendly forms for your website. The website is nicely formatted with a list to number each tip, vertical left lines to signify quotes, and pictures to break up the text. I like how some tips included a visual aid of Do's and Don'ts as well as examples of what the best practice would look like. Unfortunately, not all tips have a visual but it's resolved by included examples in text. But I would have liked if all of the tips had pictures. </p>

        <p>One example of a website form that follows some of these best practices is when <a href="https://accounts.google.com/signin" target="_blank">creating a google email</a>. The link first takes you to a page where you enter your first and last name.</p> 

        <p><img src="images/googleSignUpBD.png" alt="Screenshot of Google Sign Up"></p>

        <p>After clicking Next, there's a new page that asks for your month, day, and year of birth as well as gender. I like how the Month, Day, and Year forms are smaller than the Gender form, because users only need to put a max of 2 digits or a single word which doesn't need that much space.</p>

        <p>Overall, this article is really helpful and useful to go back and reference when I am designing my own forms. </p>
