        <h2>Best practices for Form Design</h2>
        <p><time datetime="01-20-2025">January 20, 2025</time></p>
        <p><a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best practices for form design</a> has a bunch of tips for learning how to create user friendly forms for your website. The website is nicely formatted with a list to number each tip, vertical left lines to signify quotes, and pictures to break up the text. I like how some tips included a visual aid of Do's and Don'ts as well as examples of what the best practice would look like. Unfortunately, not all tips have a visual but it's resolved by included examples in text. But I would have liked if all of the tips had pictures. </p>

        <p>One example of a website form that follows some of these best practices is when <a href="https://accounts.google.com/signin">creating a google email</a>. The link first takes you to a page where you enter your first and last name.</p> 

        <p><img src="images/googleSignUpBD.png" alt="Screenshot of Google Sign Up"></p>

        <p>After clicking Next, there's a new page that asks for your month, day, and year of birth as well as gender. I like how the Month, Day, and Year forms are smaller than the Gender form, because users only need to put a max of 2 digits or a single word which doesn't need that much space.</p>

        <p>Overall, this article is really helpful and useful to go back and reference when I am designing my own forms. </p>
