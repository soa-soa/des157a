    <p>For my 2nd version of MadLibs, I thought that the green text against a black screen didn't really fit my actual MadLibs form so I decided to change the color scheme into something that is more lighter and pastel. I took pictures of the Transformers figures that I wanted as decoration throughout and desk and made png transparents. I'm still deciding if the figures fit with the rest of the screen or not. I will have to think of something later or ask for another perspective. </p>
