    <p>For my 2nd version of MadLibs, I thought that the green text against a black screen didn't really fit my actual MadLibs form so I decided to change the color scheme into something that is lighter and pastel. I took pictures of the Transformers figures that I wanted as decoration throughout the desk and made png transparents. I'm still deciding if the figures fit with the rest of the screen or not. I will have to think of something later or ask for another perspective.</p>

    <p>I decided to have the figures and keyboard take on a more realistic look to differentiate the foreground from the background where the wall decorations and monitor itself is composed of simple 2D shapes. This did introduce the challenge of trying to integrate the 2D and 3D elements seamlessly and I feel like it still needs a bit more improvement. Maybe I can change the figureâ€™s photo settings so that they are as bright and colorful as the background? Or I can make it look like the figures were pieces of paper with ripped edges to show that subtle flatness of physical paper yet adding dimension of the 3D aspect from the paper rips?</p>

    <p>I decided to organize the form in groups of the same subject, such as asking for 4 Past Tense Action Verbs all at the same place instead of scattered about depending on the order that the words will be in the Mab Libs.</p>
