				<h1>Unhelpful Guide to Transformers</h1>
				<p>Hi y'all! I got into Transformers when the movie, Transformers One, came out! I feel like I'm still pretty new to this fandom so I still have a lot of content to digest. </p>
			</article>
		</section>

		<section id="section1">
			<article>
				<h1>Optimus Prime</h1>
				<p>Orion Pax became Optimus Prime when he was given the Matrix of Leader</p>
				<p>Before Optimus became Optimus, he was Orion Pax without the matrix of leadership (aka. the thing that turns him into a prime).</p>
				<p>If I were to think of the word "Transformers" then Optimus would be the first one that pops up into my mind, he is like the quintessential Transformer and I really admire him for being strong enough to be kind. I find it hard to NOT like him.</p>
			</article>

		<section id="TFOneDPax">
			<p>In Transformers One, he used to be best friends with D16 (Megatron before he was Megatron). I really adore how the movie explore their relationship before they became enemies.</p>

				<h1>Soundwave</h1>
				<p>Soundwave wasn't actually my favorite when I watched Transformers One (Jazz was), but I was really intriqued by him in Transformers Prime. Even though he only has a screen for a face, I found it really cool that he actually doesn't talk himself and uses other voices that he recorded to frankenstein what he wants to say.</p>

		<section id="soundwavePage2">
			<p> His most iconic form is as a cassette player where he's able to store his fellow cassettes inside his chest. There are other modes like transforming a steath bomber, jet, stealth air craft, space satellite, car, and those communication vehicles with the  satellite dishes on top.</p>
			<p>He has an arch enemy </p>
			<p>I believe he is third in command of the Decipicons and the communications officer. 
			<p>I really adore how he treats his cassettes, because in some stories, mini-cons are looked down upon because of their limited functionality and size. Him and his cassettes are most known for doing recon and infiltration missions. </p>

		<section id="cassettesPage" >
			<article>
				<h1>Cassettes</h1>
				<p>For the cassettes, there are:</p> 
				<ul>
					<li>Laserbeak (red bird)</li>
					<li>Buzzsaw (yellow bird)</li>
					<li>ravage (black panther)</li>
					<li>Rumble (blue robot)</li>
					<li>Frenzy (red robot)</li>
					<li>Ratbat (pink bat)</li>
					<li>and more that I haven't met yet...</li>
				</ul>
			</article>
		</section>

		<section id="cassettesPage2">
			<p>Laserbeak and Buzzsaw both have the same bird mode but they are red and yellow respectively. 
			<p>Ravage is a black panther.</p>
			<p>Rumble and Frenzy are identical mini transformers, their coloring is a bit confusing because their names and color schemes have been swapped a few times but I associate Rumble with Blue and Frenzy with Red. Both of them are menaces and are as tall as a human adult but compared to Soundwave, they only go up to his shin (if that gives you any indication of the scale). </p>
			<p>Last but maybe the least I know about is Ratbat, who is a pink bat (I haven't gotten to his part of the story yet and he doesn't appear very as frequently as Laserbeak or Ravage). </p>
			<p>Soundwave usually only has Laserbeak or Ravage as his companion in various version media (probably becasue too many cassettes would make them too powerful...)</p>
			<p>Another reason why I love Soundwave is also because of his cassettes. I was really fastenated with their transformations and how they all have the same alt mode as cassette tapes but then they can transform into many different shapes! </p>

			<article>
				<h1>Sideswipe</h1>
				<p>I only met him for a short bit in the beginining of the IDW comics so I don't have too. He is a spark twin with Sunstreaker, who is more vain and has yellow color schemes. Spark twins happen when a spark (a Transformers soul) splits and creates two Transformers instead of the usual one. They do have a close bond because of it.</p>
				<p>While I was looking for more Transformers One content, I came acorss some that were dedicated to Sideswipe and Sunstreaker and reading through them allowed me to gain a better understanding of their character and became a bit attached to them ha ha.</p>
			</article>
		</section>

		<section id="sideswipePage2">
			<p>I didn't realize until I seearched for it but he was also the same Transformer in the Bayverse movies that has knife for hands and moves around using the tires of his car alt mode as skates. </p>
			<p>I went to my first toy fair (of many...) with a friend at Sac where there were multiple venders who sit up tables in and around the building. I came aross Gamer's Edition Sideswipe at one of the tables and he became my first purchase! (of many...)</p>
		</section>

		<section id="sideswipePage3">
			<p>I have seen reviews about that specific toy beforehand and was seriously considering if I should buy him alongside with Bumblebee Concept Sunstreaker but the sale stopped when I was still deciding. I took a few days to consider whether I should really buy them becasue I did collect figures in the past and that collection spiraled a bit out of control...All I have to say is that only the box that my housemate's standing desk came in was enough to store them all. I needed to take precautions and really ask myself if I wanted to buy Sideswipe and Sunstreaker because I love their character or because it was on sale. My answer was given to be in the form of the the sale ending so I ended my decision at that. I felt a bit bummed out because I liked the twins and feel I should buy both and not just one.</p>
			<p>So when I came across Sideswipe are the toy show, I was super happy that I had another opportunity to buy him at around the same discount so I took it. Now I just need to find a good Sunstreaker toy to go along side him.. </p>
			<p>In my opinion, the figure is really good in the way that it's intuitive to transform. I was able to remember the steps to changing from bot to alt mode and vice versa. I like how compact Sideswipe became after changing into his alt mode. </p>

				<h1>Rodimus</h1>
				<p>Depending on the series, his name can be Hot Rod, Rodimus, Rodimus Prime (depending on if he receives the Matrix of Leadership). In the original G1 show, Rodimus became the next prime after Optimus. I think what's interesting about him is that even though he's the next Matrix of Leadership bearer, he isn't able to fill in the shoes that Optimus left behind. He wasn't able to properly become a leader nor did he want to be one due to the Optimus' revival, leading to Optimus taking the Matrix back.</p>
				<p>I really relate to him in the aspect of not feeling like your ready.</p>

		<section id="rodimusPage2">
			<p>For this specific figure, I was doom scrolling through Twitter and came across a post where they found this exact Rodimus model kit at HobbyLobby. Some other eople then commented how the HobbyLobby has this $40% off sale every other week that can be used model kts. Since we</p>
			<p>Rodimus was always out of stock whenever I checked on the website. But one day, I was just randomly checking the website again when I suddenly saw that HobbyLobby had stock so I immeidately bought it, with the shipping costs and all. I bought some tools online and started to assemble him!</p>
		</section>
		
		<section id="rodimusPage3">
			<p>The instructions for Rodimus were fairly smooth to follow but I did encounter some steps where attaching a limb or reparing it into something useful. I was extremely cautious of only cutting what I need for one step at a time and then buying for it. A really small piece that attaches the arm to the hand just flew off of my tweezers when I tried to slot that piece inside. </p>
			<p>I really adore the finished product, he is really pretty! One of the advantages of model kits is that they offer great flexibility and articulated limbs. But Rodimus' legs keept on falling off so I applied some clear nail polish to the peg so that it can fit in more tightly. I have him on my desk as I'm writing this! :> </p>
